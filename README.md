## Workflow ðŸ’»

### Backend: 
**Step 1**
Add a new Entity and decorate them with type-graphql and typeorm to tell PostgreSQL how
the new table looks like.
Files need to be Uppercase like `User.tsx`.

**Step 2**
Add Resolver to make actions on an Entity (e.g. actions, validation, authentification)
Resolvers are written in lowercase like `user.tsx`, and need the same name as the entity they are assigned to.

ðŸ’¡ Some basic decorator and types whe use:
- Resolvers: query, mutation
- Types: InputType and ObjectType

ðŸ•® InputTypes are used for inputs on forms etc.
ðŸ•® ObjectTypes are used for describing the Response Object of a Response etc.

**Step 3**
Run Mutations with typeorm when one of your Entity needs a change (or revert a migration)

ðŸ•® For breaking changes for example adding a required field to an existing entity, we need  to wipe out the database table or make the field nullable (optional)

---

### Frontend: 

**Step 1**
Add graphql mutations, queries depending on the new Resolver.

**Step 2** 
run `npm run gen` to autogenerate types from the backend schema.

This generates types from the schema defined on our server (all entities, resolvers)
On Top of that we can add our own types to the schema in the graphQL folder on the client (fragments, mutations, querys, urql-mutation-hooks)
Urql mutation hooks are based on our schema types and so we dont need to write our own hooks to update our component state.

## How to startup:
Need to config your postgreSQL for the fist time ?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1471571/how-to-configure-postgresql-for-the-first-time

BEFORE START:

sudo service postgresql status
sudo service postgresql start

tab1:
redis-server
redis-cli ping

tab2:
npm run dev

**PSQL**
```psql
sql -d littlereddit -U phil
SELECT * FROM post;
SELECT * FROM "user"; (user needs quotes, maybe because of conflict with reserved keyword)
DELETE FROM "user" WHERE username='eeeeeeee'; (singleQuoteHere)
DELETE FROM "user" WHERE username!='Philipp'; (deletes every user except me)
\d (list all tables)
\l (list all databases)
\du (list all users)
```
ðŸ•® We can also view data on pgadmin4(littlereddit)

**delete DB create DB create DB-Tables with bash or psql**

```bash
createdb dbname
dropdb dbname
```

```psql
CREATE DATABASE [databasename]; or create database littlereddit;
DROP DATABASE littlereddit;   or drop database littlereddit;
```

INFO: "synchronize": true, => automatically creates the DB tables for you without running
      migrations. (set this to false if you manually use migrations to create a table)

**TODOS:** 
- register and login works but after hardrefresh logined user gets logged out


## typorm migrations
https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/docs/migrations.md
- add an empty migration where you can write SQL manually and run your self created migrations afterwards
npm run typeorm migration:create -- -n myCustomMigration
- generates a new migrations, depending on the current entities (only if changed since the last migration run):
npm run typeorm migration:generate -- -n UserMigration2
- runs all missing migration (mostly the last one with the newest timestamp):
npm run typeorm migration:run
- reverts the last migration (newest timestamp):
npm run typeorm migration:revert 

### Graphql Vscode Extension
To get intellisense depending on your graphql schema 
Schema can be found on your graphql endpoint for example: http://localhost:4000/graphql
1. install vscode extension locally
- name in vscode extension store: graphql.vscode-graphql

## this project includes follow technologies

- React
- TypeScript
- GraphQL
- URQL/Apollo
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- MikroORM/TypeORM
- Redis
- Next.js
- TypeGraphQL
- TailwindCSSj

## versions

postgresql: 12.4
node: 14.5.0
npm: 6.14.5

## scripts explanation

- npm run watch (compiles ts to js into dist folder)
- node dist/index.js
- start is faster as start2
- "tsc -w" recompiles our typescript code everytime we change a typescript file
- "nodemon dist/index.js" re-execute the js code that changes in the dist folder

## shell history

mkdir gh/newreddit && cd gh/newreddit
code .
npm init -y
nvm install 14.5.0
nvm alias default 14.5
nvm ls
npm -v
npm install -D @types/node typescript ts-node nodemon pg @types/express (alternative ts-node-dev instead of ts-node)
npm install express apollo-server-express graphql type-graphql \
reflect-metadata
npm install class-validator (only needed if tsconfig>skipLipCheck = false)
npx tsconfig.json (select node)
npm install cors
npm install -D @types/cors
npm install nodemailer
npm install -D @types/nodemailer
npm install uuid ioredis
npm install -D @types/uuid @types/ioredis
npm uninstall redis 

## setup eslint with prettier (non-react or react, link: <https://www.robertcooper.me/using-eslint-and-prettier-in-a-typescript-project>)

npm install eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin --dev

npm install prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier --dev

npm install redis connect-redis express-session (alternative ioredis instead of redis)
npm install -D @types/redis @types/express-session @type/connect-redis

## if redis cookie called 'qid' dont show up under devtools>application>cookies you need to go to browser localhost:4000/graphql > settings > set "request.credentials": "omit",  to "request.credentials": "include"
